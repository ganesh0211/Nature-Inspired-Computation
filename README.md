# Travelling-thief-problem

Problem Statement and data file:

TSP module:

modified a bit by me.

Here we do not consider thief return to the start node, but it can be implemented easily with a little modification in code.

Plot shows profit gained from each city and green circle is starting point for thief. (for 280 cities and 5 items per city)
